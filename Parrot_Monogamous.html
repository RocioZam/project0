<p>When it comes to relationships, most people tend to fall into the monogamous side of things. Monogamy is a term used to describe a human that is married or in a relationship to one other human. Basically, they&rsquo;re in a faithful relationship that is geared toward building it together as a whole. On the other hand, some humans follow polygamous relationships. Polygamous relationships are the polar opposite of a monogamous relationship in which a partner has multiple partners rather than one. However, none of that really matters. It all depends on the person and their own individual beliefs. Since we&rsquo;re on the subject, you&rsquo;re probably wondering if parrots are monogamous.</p>
<p><strong>To answer the questionâ€¦yes, parrots are monogamous. Oddly enough parrots tend to find one partner and stick with them. In the wild, they&rsquo;ll stay near each other, find food together, and so on. Generally speaking, most species of animals are polygamous and aren&rsquo;t faithful to one another. However, this isn&rsquo;t the case with parrots. They look for a partner and under very rare circumstances do they leave their partner for another or seek another partner at the same time.</strong></p>
